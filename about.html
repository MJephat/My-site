    <p> My name is Jepha Mukundi Maina. Iam curruntly a student at Moringa 
        school studying siftware engineering. Asparing to become a fullstuck
        software developer at the end of my extensive 25 weeks of study. It is my 
        that at the end of the course i will be able to develop and 
        will have made changes to my web site.<b>!! ADIOS!!</b>
    </p>
    <p>Before i ever thought of becoming a software developer, i was in another
        line of profession. Like other people i went to a University to study a course
        that was not related to technology at any kind, form or shape. I then discovered that
        i was kind off missing something. That when i gained interest in deep computer tech other than 
        the basic entertainment purposes.
    </p>
    <p> I hope by the end of my time of study at Moringa School i will be able to
        be writing codes, reading and creating wonderful projects using
        various languages such as:-<b>html, css, ruby, javascript </b>and others but 
        my main language of all time will be <i><b>PYTHON!</b></i>.
